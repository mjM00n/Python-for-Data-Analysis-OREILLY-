# Python-for-Data-Analysis-OREILLY-
This repository is simply code I will be practicing through Jupyter Notebook from the O'Reilly book Python for Data Anlaysis 2nd edition. I am trying to improve my coding, so I am hoping to read a series of books to better hone my skillset and then use these skills to complete some independent projects using a variety of methods and libraries I learn.
